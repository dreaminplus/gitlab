# Iterations **(STARTER)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214713) in [GitLab Starter](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 13.1.

Iterations behave similarly to [milestones](../../project/milestones/index.md), with a few differences:

- Iterations are only available to groups
- Iterations must have both a start date and due date
- Iteration date range can not overlap

## View the iterations list

To view the iterations list, in a group, go to **{issues}** **Issues > Iterations**.
From there you can create a new iteration or click an iteration to get a more detailed view.

## Create an iteration

NOTE: **Note:**
A permission level of [Developer or higher](../../permissions.md) is required to create iterations.

To create an iteration:

1. In a group, go to **{issues}** **Issues > Iterations**.
1. Click **New iteration**.
1. Enter the title, a description (optional), a start date, and a due date.
1. Click **Create iteration**. The iteration details page opens.

<!-- ## Troubleshooting

Include any troubleshooting steps that you can foresee. If you know beforehand what issues
one might have when setting this up, or when something is changed, or on upgrading, it's
important to describe those, too. Think of things that may go wrong and include them here.
This is important to minimize requests for support, and to avoid doc comments with
questions that you know someone might ask.

Each scenario can be a third-level heading, e.g. `### Getting error message X`.
If you have none to add when creating a doc, leave this section in place
but commented out to help encourage others to add to it in the future. -->
