# Iterations **(STARTER)**

> - Introduced in GitLab 13.1

Iterations behave similarly to [milestones](doc/user/project/milestones/index.md), with a few differences:

- Iterations are only available to groups
- Iterations must have both a start date and due date
- Iteration date range can not overlap

Navigate to **Issues > Iterations** in a group to view the iterations list. From there you can create a new iteration, or click an iteration for a more detailed view.

## Creating iterations

To create an **iteration**, navigate to **Issues > Iterations** in the group and click **New iteration**.
